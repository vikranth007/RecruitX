> ### **📜 The Manifesto: Hiring is a high-stakes intelligence problem.**
> The traditional hiring process is broken. It's a chaotic storm of biased intuition, manual drudgery, and missed opportunities. Recruiters drown in resumes while top candidates slip through the cracks. **RecruitX** is the lighthouse in the storm. It is an autonomous, AI-driven hiring agent designed to dissect talent with surgical precision. By leveraging advanced language models and a sophisticated analysis engine, RecruitX transforms recruitment from a game of chance into a science of strategic talent acquisition. We don't just find candidates. We identify future cornerstones of your organization.

### **🎬 The System in Action**
<div align="center">
  <p>A seamless, intuitive workflow guiding you from job description to final decision.</p>

### **🧠 The Architecture: An Intelligence-Augmented Workflow**
RecruitX is engineered as a multi-stage, AI-native application. It employs a sophisticated pipeline that combines structured data extraction, explainable scoring, and dynamic, on-the-fly reasoning to deliver unparalleled insights into your talent pool.

<details>
<summary><strong>🏛️ Click to Explore the Core Architectural Pillars</strong></summary>

| Pillar | Description | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Requirement Extraction** | The system first atomizes a complex job description into its most critical, non-negotiable requirements. | An LLM call guided by a `Pydantic` model (`KeyRequirements`) ensures a structured, reliable list of core competencies is extracted. |
| **2. Explainable Scoring (XAI)** | Each candidate is scored against the weighted requirements. Crucially, every point deduction is justified with evidence (or lack thereof) directly from the resume. | The `score_candidate_explainable` function uses a detailed prompt and a `Pydantic` model (`ExplainableCandidateScore`) to force the LLM to "show its work," providing a transparent audit trail for every decision. |
| **3. Per-Candidate RAG** | A unique Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is dynamically created for each candidate. This allows for a deep, interactive "chat" with their resume. | `FAISS` vector stores are built in-memory for each resume, powered by `FastEmbedEmbeddings`. This enables a `LangChain` retrieval chain to answer nuanced questions with pinpoint accuracy, based solely on the candidate's document. |
| **4. Automated Communication** | The system generates personalized email drafts for interview invitations and rejections based on the final rankings and user-defined criteria. | LLM-generated text is used to craft context-aware emails, saving hours of manual writing and ensuring a professional candidate experience. |

### **✨ Code Spotlight: The Anatomy of Explainable Scoring**
This is where RecruitX transcends simple keyword matching. The system forces the AI to justify its entire reasoning process, providing a clear, auditable analysis for every candidate.

```python
# SourceCode/utils.py (Illustrative Snippet)
class RequirementMatch(BaseModel):
    requirement: str
    match_status: bool
    evidence: str

class ExplainableCandidateScore(BaseModel):
    name: str
    overall_score: int
    summary: str
    requirement_analysis: List[RequirementMatch]

def score_candidate_explainable(
    job_description: str, 
    resume_text: str, 
    weighted_requirements: Dict, 
    llm: BaseChatModel
) -> ExplainableCandidateScore:
    """
    Scores a candidate with detailed, explainable AI using a reliable two-step approach.
    """
    prompt = """
    **TASK:** Evaluate a candidate's resume against a job description and weighted requirements.
    Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.

    **SCORING RULES:**
    1. Start at 100 points.
    2. For each requirement, if no direct evidence is found, deduct points based on importance.
    3. The `overall_score` is the final calculated score.

    **JSON OUTPUT SCHEMA:** You must fill out the ExplainableCandidateScore structure...
    
    **USER-PROVIDED DATA:**
    1. WEIGHTED REQUIREMENTS: {weights}
    2. JOB DESCRIPTION: {jd}
    3. RESUME TEXT: {resume}
    """
    # The magic happens here: LangChain's `with_structured_output`
    # binds the LLM's response to our Pydantic model.
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(ExplainableCandidateScore)
    chain = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt) | structured_llm
    
    response = chain.invoke({
        "weights": json.dumps(weighted_requirements),
        "jd": job_description,
        "resume": resume_text[:6000] # Truncate for context window
    })
    
    return response
```
